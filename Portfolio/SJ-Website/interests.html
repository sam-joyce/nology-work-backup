  <h1>What I want from _nology</h1>
  <p>From _nology I want a start in tech. I want the skills and confidence in order to get a position as a Software Developer as well as begin building custom websites for people.
    I think _nology will provide me with this due to it's focus on the real world application of up and coming skills in tech. My previous career was very 1 dimensional, and required me to be in an office at a desk.
    I am looking forward to a much more flexible career in tech where I can work in multiple different ways as opposed to a conventional 9-5.
